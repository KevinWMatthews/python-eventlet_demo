# eventlet.websocket does not seem to contain a method for creating a client websocket connection
# Neither does the stock websocket module.
# Can try using the websocket-client module (https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/)
# Can also try using SocketIO, but their docs seem to be for websocket servers.

print('Not implemented. Load websocket_client.html in a browser instead.')
